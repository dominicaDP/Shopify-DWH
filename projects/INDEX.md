## Multi-Project Strategies

### Time Blocking
Dedicate specific hours to each project:
- Morning: Project A
- Afternoon: Project B

### Priority-Based
Switch based on urgency from `/overview`

### Batching
Group similar tasks across projects:
- All meetings together
- All coding together
- All reviews together
