## Research Log

### 2026-01-29 - Second Brain Setup

**Topic:** Knowledge Management System

**What I learned:**
- Three-layer architecture: Commands → Skills → Memory
- Progressive disclosure pattern for managing complexity
- Pattern confidence levels (LOW → MEDIUM → HIGH)

**Key Commands:**
- `/overview` - Daily dashboard
- `/switch [project]` - Context switching
- `/learn` - Extract patterns from work
- `/recall [topic]` - Search memory
- `/grow` - Brain health metrics

**Next Steps:**
- Explore each command
- Start capturing research findings
- Develop personal workflow
