## Health Indicators

| Indicator | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Daily `/learn` habit | 🟡 Starting | Run after completing work |
| Pattern extraction | 🟢 Active | 19 patterns in first week |
| Context preservation | 🟢 Active | 10 episodic entries |
| Weekly review | 🟡 Pending | Run `/grow` weekly |

---

## Goals

### Week 1 ✅
- [x] Extract 5+ patterns via `/learn` → **19 extracted**
- [x] Document 1+ completed work in episodic memory → **10 documented**
- [x] Create first project with full context → **Shopify DWH**

### Month 1
- [x] Reach 10+ patterns → **19 patterns**
- [ ] Promote 3+ patterns to MEDIUM confidence (currently 3)
- [ ] Establish daily `/learn` habit

### Month 3
- [ ] Reach 25+ patterns
- [ ] Have 5+ HIGH confidence patterns
- [ ] Track measurable time savings

## Pattern Confidence Promotion Queue

Patterns approaching promotion (based on uses):

| Pattern | Current | Uses | Needs |
|---------|---------|------|-------|
| Mid-Session Checkpointing | LOW | 2 | 1 more use → MEDIUM |
| Shopify Cost Data Location | MEDIUM | 2 | 1 more use → HIGH candidate |

---

## Notes

- Week 1 was heavily focused on Shopify DWH project
- Most patterns are domain-specific (Shopify API)
- Process patterns have highest reuse potential
- Consider extracting more general patterns from future projects
